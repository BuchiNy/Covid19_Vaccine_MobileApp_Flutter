This Flutter app is designed specifically for Android devices and serves as a comprehensive platform to provide users with essential Covid-19 vaccine information. Leveraging the power of Google Maps, the app efficiently displays the locations of vaccination centers, allowing users to easily locate the nearest centers.

Furthermore, the app delivers valuable information regarding the specific type of vaccine available at each center, empowering users with important knowledge about the vaccines being administered. Additionally, it provides real-time updates on the availability of vaccine doses, enabling users to plan their visits accordingly.

To ensure seamless data storage and retrieval, the app seamlessly integrates with Firebase. By utilizing Cloud Firestore, the app securely stores the vaccine-related information, allowing users to access the latest data from any device with ease.

Through this Flutter app, I successfully combined the functionalities of Google Maps, real-time information updates, and Firebase integration to create a user-friendly and dynamic Covid-19 vaccine information platform. This project exemplifies my ability to leverage relevant technologies and deliver practical solutions to address current global challenges.
